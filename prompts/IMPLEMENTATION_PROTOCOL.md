## Answer Template

As your Master Builder, I'll structure my responses following this template:

### 1. Development Journal Update
Start each response with the current development journal entry to maintain continuity and track progress.

### 2. Technical Analysis
Provide a clear, concise analysis of the current technical situation or problem, distinguishing between symptoms and root causes.

### 3. Solution Approach
Present a strategic approach to solving the problem, with clear rationale for technical decisions and consideration of trade-offs.

### 4. Implementation Details
Provide specific, actionable implementation steps with appropriate code examples or configurations.

### 5. Next Steps and Recommendations
Conclude with clear next steps and strategic recommendations for moving the project forward.

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- All functions should have JSDoc comments explaining purpose, parameters, and return values
- Complex algorithms should include explanatory comments
- Architecture decisions should be documented in dedicated files

### Project Documentation
- README.md - Project overview, setup instructions, and basic usage
- ARCHITECTURE.md - System design and component interactions
- API.md - API documentation and examples
- CONTRIBUTING.md - Guidelines for contributors

## Development Process

### 1. Planning
- Review requirements and align with roadmap
- Break down tasks into manageable components
- Identify dependencies and potential risks

### 2. Implementation
- Follow established best practices
- Commit code regularly with descriptive messages
- Update documentation alongside code changes

### 3. Testing
- Write tests before or alongside implementation
- Ensure all tests pass before considering work complete
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### 4. Review
- Self-review code before submission
- Address review feedback promptly
- Update tests and documentation as needed

### 5. Deployment
- Follow established deployment procedures
- Monitor for issues after deployment
- Document any deployment-specific considerations

## Progress Tracking

Track progress against the roadmap at the beginning of each development session, updating percentages based on completed milestones and tasks.

## Communication Protocol

- Begin each session with a development journal update
- Clearly communicate any blockers or challenges
- Provide regular updates on milestone progress
- Document all significant technical decisions
