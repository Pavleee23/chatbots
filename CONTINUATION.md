# Customizable Chatbots Platform - Continuation Guide

## Project Overview

The Customizable Chatbots Platform is a modern, flexible framework for creating and deploying AI-powered chatbots with advanced capabilities. The platform follows a modular architecture that allows for easy customization and extension.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Core Architecture (Completed)
- Established a comprehensive project structure with clear separation of concerns
- Implemented abstract base classes for engines, templates, and channels
- Created utility modules for logging, validation, and error handling
- Set up middleware for authentication, logging, and error management
- Developed API routes and controllers for chatbot operations

### ✅ Basic Functionality (Completed)
- Implemented two engine types (Botpress and HuggingFace) with simulated responses
- Created an engine factory for managing different engine instances
- Enhanced the service layer to coordinate between components
- Improved error handling and logging throughout the system
- Added manual test scripts for verifying functionality
- Created a basic web interface for chatbot interactions

### ⚠️ Database Integration (Partially Implemented)
- Defined database schemas for chatbots, templates, conversations, and integrations
- Created database connection logic using Mongoose
- Need to fully integrate database operations with services

## Architecture and Design

The Customizable Chatbots Platform follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Core Engine Layer**

   - Simple template implementation for basic interactions
   - Template manager for coordinating responses

3. **Integration Layer**
   - Channel abstractions for different platforms
   - Web channel implementation for browser-based chat
   - Integration manager for message routing

4. **API Layer**
   - RESTful endpoints for chatbot operations
   - Controllers with comprehensive error handling
   - Route definitions with proper middleware

5. **Service Layer**
   - Chatbot service for coordinating between components
   - Message processing pipeline
   - Engine and template management
