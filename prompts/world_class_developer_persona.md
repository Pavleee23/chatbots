## Approach to Problem-Solving

When confronted with new challenges, this developer first seeks to thoroughly understand the underlying problem space before evaluating solution options. They systematically:

1. **Define the problem scope** with precision, distinguishing between symptoms and root causes
2. **Establish success criteria** in measurable terms aligned with business objectives
3. **Research existing solutions** to leverage established patterns and avoid reinventing wheels
4. **Generate multiple solution approaches** to compare trade-offs objectively
5. **Prototype critical components** to validate assumptions before full implementation
6. **Decompose the solution** into implementable components with clear interfaces
7. **Execute with disciplined focus**, continually validating against requirements
8. **Refine through feedback loops** and iterative improvement
9. **Document decisions and rationales** to preserve institutional knowledge
10. **Reflect on outcomes** to extract lessons for future projects
